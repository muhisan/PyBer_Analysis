# Ride sharing data analysis
## 1. Overview of the analysis
   The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize Pyber ride sharing data and
create compelling analysis and visualization for the CEO. Our work will help PyBer improve 
access to ride sharing services, the affordability of the ride sharinng and also it will help determine where the resources and support are needed.

### Resources
- Python 3.8.8 
- Jupyter notebook 6.4.0

## 2. Results
After combining and analyzing PyBers ride sharing data, I came up with a statistical overview and a summary that follows:
![summary DataFrame](https://github.com/muhisan/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/summary%20DataFrame.png)

Here, in the above summary, we see that details change across cities:
- Rural areas have the lowest number of rides and Drivers compared to other areas (urban and suburban) 
- The total fares is high in the Urban cities as the demande in rides is high.
- In contrast, if we consider the average fare per Ride and the average fare per Driver ,it is clear that Drivers in rural cities are making more revenue per ride than others.

This multiple-line graph complements the above summary, we can observe that total fares vary by city type, they are high in urban and lower in suburban and rural cities respectively and throughout the January to April period. In addition, we can also clearly see the most profitable months and those that have the least. For example, incomes start to rise a bit in all cities around the end of February, and then fall again in March and so on, depending on the city.

## 3. Summary
Based on the summary of the analysis, I would recommend to the CEO that the number of drivers and rides in rural areas be increased so that fares can be lowered accordingly. To get there, he can increase the profits for example of drivers in the rural areas to encourage them.
